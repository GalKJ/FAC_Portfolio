## 2. Make a web page more readable for screen readers

The alt tag in the above screenshot will be read out by a screen reader. Also using proper semantic HTML tags such as H1/2/3... will ensure they are read out as headings. 

## 3. Design a UI without relying solely on colour, so that we donâ€™t exclude colour-blind users

## 4. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

The above screen shot confims that the site was built in order to be accessible for users whether colour blind or not.

## 5. Use various tools to check that a website meets accessibility criteria

We used Chrome Lighthouse and W3 HTML validator https://validator.w3.org/

## 6. Ensure a website displays well on screens of different sizes

By using HTML elements that naturally adjust to different screen sizes as well as specific styles such as `width: 100%;` on imgaes our page was responsive.

## 7. Use CSS media queries to ensure content is always presented effectively

## 8. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to designing a website with a great user experience

## 9. Create an attractive and accessible colour palette for a project

- We used colour sparingly but effectivly to lift the cards from the page.

## 10. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements
